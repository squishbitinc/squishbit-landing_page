# About Squishbit

This page is available at /pages/about/.

Squishbit automatically optimizes and delivers your images in the best possible format and size, so your pages load fast without compromising on visual quality.

- Up to 90% smaller file sizes
- 100% visual quality
- Faster page loads and better conversions

We handle the heavy lifting—from intelligent format selection (like AVIF/WebP) to tuned compression—so you can focus on building your store and content.

## How it works

1. Install the Squishbit Shopify app
2. We process your images and pick the optimal format and quality
3. Images are served quickly through our CDN

The result is a consistently fast experience across mobile and desktop.

## Technology we use

This site uses:
- Jekyll for static site generation
- TailwindCSS for styling
- AlpineJS for small UI interactions

These tools keep the site lightweight and easy to maintain.

## Example image

Below is a sample image delivered locally from this site. In production, Squishbit would deliver the same image from the CDN in an optimal format:

![Sample bird image]({{ '/images/4k-bird.jpg' | relative_url }})
